**OpenSearch** is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine developed by Amazon. It is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to integrate with applications for real-time search and data analysis. In this workshop, you will learn how to integrate AWS OpenSearch into a simple serverless application using AWS Lambda, S3, and CloudFront.

By using OpenSearch, you gain several advantages that traditional database search mechanisms do not provide:

- Powerful full-text search capabilities with relevance scoring
- Real-time indexing and querying of data
- Scalability for handling large datasets
- Tight integration with other AWS services like Lambda, IAM, and CloudWatch
- Built-in security features such as fine-grained access control and encryption
- Visualize data with OpenSearch Dashboards
- Fully managed service with high availability and automatic backups
- Easily deploy search features without maintaining search infrastructure

With these benefits, OpenSearch is an ideal choice for applications that require robust search functionality with minimal infrastructure management. This workshop will guide you step-by-step to set up OpenSearch, index data, query it through a Lambda function, and display results on a static website hosted on AWS.
